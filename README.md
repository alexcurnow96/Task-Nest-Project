# TASK NEST

### Project description
"Welcome to the place where productivity meets simplicity. Here you can, quite simply, "get it done, one task at a time". All tasks can be organised and achieved through projects, tasks and subtasks. Useable as a one person show or as a member of the team, we want to make your planning simple."

Task Nest is a todo application, focused on offering a simple way to track your tasks. Users can, once authorised, add a task, view the task in on it's own page, edit the task form, and delete the task. Users can also add comments to each task from the task view page.

## User Interface Design (UI)

### Inspiration
I started by using a mindmap to establish an idea. I knew I wanted to create a site based on project management as I would like to get into that field after this course. I have also recieved feedback on my previous projects to indicate that my planning and project management skills were my best aspect.

My overall thinking was to create a simple to use, easy to look at site to help those wanting to organise their projects. This would feature:

- user creation and profiles to have individual lists and team boards
- kanban board to visualise tasks and enhance workflow
- ability to collaborate to optimise teamwork
- todo list to organise tasks further
- ability to prioritise tasks for an individual
- site to enhance productivity

I then created an MVP from these ideas which included a simple to-do list with user registration and log in. This would fulfill the CRUD functionality needed for the project. 

I then began looking into competitors sites/apps to see what as already on the market and what appeared to be popular. 

![Project Ideas](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/ideas-for-project.png)

These included:
- [A simple to do list for you and your team (any.do)](https://www.any.do/)
- [Todoist | A To-Do List to Organize Your Work & Life](https://todoist.com/)
- [Manage Your Teamâ€™s Projects From Anywhere | Trello](https://trello.com/)
- [KanbanFlow - Lean project management. Simplified.](https://kanbanflow.com/)
- [Kanban Tool - Kanban Boards for Business | Kanban Software](https://kanbantool.com/)
- [Home (taskworld.com)](https://taskworld.com/)
- [MeisterTask | Work Management Software | Task Management](https://www.meistertask.com/)

I chose these sites as inspiration for my board because I liked their simplicity. It also seemed as though I could ____ achieve my goals and create my own project site.

### Wireframes

I began my wireframing journey by sketching with pen and paper. This was a very simple and early idea, made using a template. 
![sketched wireframe](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/sketched-wireframe.png)

I then began wireframing using my Miro board, using shapes and lines. These were able to give me a better idea of what I wanted the site to look like. In this iteration I included both desktop and mobile versions of each page, including all pages I could possibly make for this project. 
![wireframe board on Miro](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/wireframes.png)

I then tried using Figma.com to create more complex wireframes/prototypes. I made one prototype, but could not get on with this tool. 
![Figma prototype](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/prototype.png)

My finished wireframes were made using the Balsamiq application and featured every page I wanted to create in desktop and mobile view. This became my best planning tool when it came to development as I knew exactly what I wanted to create.

### Brand Identity
A big part of User Interface Design is the brand identity. This is how users recognise the site and build trust. I established this identity by first creating a brand name. I used the generative powers of AI by asking Perplexity.com to create names for a task management website. The responses from Perplexity were varied and most included alliterative names. Both of my previous projects with CI have featured alliterative names so I wanted to steer clear of that this time. The name Task Nest was featured and this became the name I started referring to my project as. 
![Design Miro Board](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/design-ideas.png)

The brand colours are also a big part of the brand identity of Task Nest. My market research had led to me being pulled to a monochrome colour scheme. The different shades of one colour being used throughout the site made it look more professional for the use of development teams and individuals. 

Upon looking into brand colours, I found that blue is a "harmonious colour that is stress relieving and does not disturb the focus of the brain, resulting in more efficient work being delivered." (https://www.haiken.com/insights/the-top-colours-for-your-office-to-increase-productivity) For this reason I chose an all blue colour scheme. 
"[Colour Scheme](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/colour-scheme.jpeg)

I then used Adobe Firefly to create a logo for the website that would feature on the nav bar. This would provide an added layer of trust to the site and become a recognisable part of the brand. I used the checkpoints from the to-do list inside of a birds nest to make it clear that this logo belongs to the brand. 
![Logo](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/logo.jpg)

The typography came at the end of the design process as I wanted it to follow the professionalism of the rest of the branding design. I started by looking at www.fontpair.co, and choosing a series of font pairings that I thought could work for Task Nest. When looking at the final choices, I noticed that they all featured "Karla" as a heading font. This became the natural heading font, and the pairing of "Inconsolata" went well for the paragraph elements. These fonts were then procured from Google Fonts (fonts.google.com).

### Interaction Design 
The interactivity of a website is also incredibly important. This includes the basic interaction, use of buttons, drag and drop, user creation, but also more complex interactions within a site. For this reason, I researched the 10 Usability Heuristics and how to assess where a design is falling short and where it is excelling. This also looks into what aspects of design can be sacrificed and what needs to be prioritised. 

The most important heuristics for my project are user control and freedom, consistency and standards, and recognition rather than recall. These are all prioritising the users ability to move throughout the site with clearly marked actions. The CRUD functionality should be clearly marked and, if a user makes a mistake by clicking on an action when they do not want to, there should be clear signposts to return. This should be the same on every page throughout the site. 


### Accessibility
Throughout this course, the accessibility of users has been highlighted. For this reason, I wanted to plan for accessibility issues before I had begun coding my site. This would make sure my site was useable by everyone who had need to use it. This was a relatively easy portion of the design as I didn't want to complicate accessibility. This should be at the forefront of my design and should not be thought of as extra complications to the design. 

The accessibility designs I made were to use large buttons and large font throughout the site, to implement a light/dark toggle mode for those who wish to use the site on either setting, and an overall simple app functionality with an easy to follow user flow for all users. 

These would all be planned for and tested at the end of my project to ensure the site is functional for all users. 

## User Experience (UX)

### Database Planning
I began my database design by sketching out my models and an entity relationship diagram. Because of my previous experience in SQL, I began by following the principles of MySQL and used integer, varchar, and set. This helped me understand what I was going to create in the backend of this site. 
![Sketched ERD](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/sketched-erd.png)

I then began using LucidChart (www.lucidchart.com) to create an actual ERD to be used in my project. This included Users, Tasks and Subtasks with primary keys and foreign keys. This allowed me to create simple models with simple connections. 
![Lucidchart diagram](https://github.com/alexcurnow96/portfolio-project/blob/main/documentation/planning/tasknest.png)

I then discovered that you could import the user model from Django AllAuth, and decided to use that functionality for the Users model.


### The Purpose and Target Audience
My target audience are individuals within teams in a project. There is also a secondary audience of just individuals who want to achieve tasks generally. 

The purpose of this website is related to project management. I wanted to create something that would enable productivity and streamline working practices. I am also aware that this site can be used by anyone who would like to log their tasks and be more productive though. 

### User Journeys
All users journey through a website, and I needed to keep in mind the path users would take on mine. I wanted to keep the site as simple as possible for the user to navigate. This reduced the amount of pages I had, and reduced the amount of decisions for the user to make. 

The CRUD functionality was the main focus of the site. This included the ability to create tasks, read the tasks, update the tasks, and delete the tasks when completed.

### Agile
I took an agile approach to this project, focusing on the user and iterating my work to better create my project. 

I started my agile approach by creating my user stories, justifying all choices from the perspective of users and developers. I tried to create users stories from a range of perspectives, not limited to just end users but also developers, team leaders and project managers. Although this proved to be ambitious given the time frame and my own abilities, I felt these perspectives gave me confidence to complete my project. 


I used a github projects kanban board to organise my user stories. I used it as a visual guide to my progress throught the project, moving tasks from one column to another based on where I was in my sprints. There were four columns on my board: 
1. Backlog: This section housed all of the user stories at the beginning of the project. It was then used for the tasks that would not be completed in this iteration, due to time constraints or my own ability with the technologies. Therefore, the backlog almost became a future features section too.
2. Todo: This column was used for items that hadn't been started but needed to be worked on in one of my upcoming sprints. This section served to help when planning my tasks per day.
3. In Progress: This section was for items currently being worked on. I could keep on task when stories were placed into this column, and had a visual guide as to how far along in my sprint I was. If a task was not completed in a given sprint, it was placed back into the todo column for the next day. 
4. Done: This column was for all completed tasks. Tasks only made it to the done column once they had been fully completed. This was a great motivator to see what stories I had already completed.

Each user story had a MoSCoW prioritisation label attached to it. These labels were added in the middle of the project as I felt this helped me understand where I was within the project better. At the beginning I was hopeful (and naive) enough to think that I could fulfill all user stories. But during the project I realised that my MVP was the most important aspect of the project and so used the prioritisation labels to reflect that. This helped me in my planning towards the second half of the project because I focused on only the must have features.

My MVP became a very simple task app rather than a full project management app. I felt that the Kanban board and team organisation aspects were better suited to a future iteration of my project. The site would fulfill the criteria for the project, and work well for users as just a simple to-do list task app. 

The biggest aspect of Agile I used in this project was my sprints. I took each day as a seperate sprint to achieve an aspect of my plan. This was only possible because of the daily scrum meetings led by my facilitator, Amy. The scheduled meetings at 9am and 4pm helped keep my sprints contained and the ability to talk about that days work kept me focused. I seldom ran into problems because of our daily meetings and this also helped boost my confidence going into the next days sprints.
